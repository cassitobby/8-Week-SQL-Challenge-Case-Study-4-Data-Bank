# Introduction
There is a new innovation in the financial industry called Neo-Banks: new aged digital only banks without physical branches.

Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data world‚Ä¶so he decides to launch a new initiative - Data Bank!

Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn‚Äôt only for banking activities, they also have the world‚Äôs most secure distributed data storage platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help!

# Problem Statement
The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

# Recommendation

1. Determine the approach for managing customers with consistently low account balances and develop an efficient strategy for allocating data storage to them.

2. Continuously monitor and analyze the data allocation trends over time to identify patterns, fluctuations, or any significant changes. This will help in understanding the evolving data storage needs and making informed decisions regarding resource allocation.

3. Conduct a more detailed analysis of individual customer data to understand their specific data storage requirements and patterns. This can help tailor resource allocation and service offerings to meet the unique needs of each customer.

4. Continuously evaluate and adjust resource allocation strategies based on changing data storage needs, technological advancements, and customer requirements. Regularly review and update allocation plans to ensure they align with business goals and optimize resource utilization.
