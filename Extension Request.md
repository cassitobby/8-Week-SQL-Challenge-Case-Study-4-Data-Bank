# Extension Request

The Data Bank team wants you to use the outputs generated from the above sections to create a quick Powerpoint presentation which will be used as marketing materials for both external investors who might want to buy Data Bank shares and new prospective customers who might want to bank with Data Bank.

Using the outputs generated from the customer node questions, generate a few headline insights which Data Bank might use to market itâ€™s world-leading security features to potential investors and customers.

With the transaction analysis - prepare a 1 page presentation slide which contains all the relevant information about the various options for the data provisioning so the Data Bank management team can make an informed decision.

You can check out the PowerPoint slide [here](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=8930EFA906C19CFA!106&ithint=file%2cpptx&authkey=!AFhALcXQ5PqribM)
